## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack web developer with experience in building dynamic and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and more. I have a keen interest in developing meaningful products that solve real-world problems, like the crowdsourced city improvement platform I built during my college project.
